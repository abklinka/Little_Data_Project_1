# Little_Data_Project_1
# Hurricanes have a negative effect on the stock market (S&P1500).
## GT Bootcamp Project
* A look at how hurricanes from 2014 to 2018 affected the S&P1500
* The 2014-2018 daily returns of the S&P 1500 were pulled and plotted against a +/- 21 day period when hurricanes hit the US mainland with 2015 being a control year as there were no hurricanes for the year.  
* T-tests were used rather than regression analysis in order to determine significance of the changes in the daily returns for the duration of the hurricanes rather than a corelation.
* It was determined that the difference in the daily returns was significant in contrast to the hurricane free years
